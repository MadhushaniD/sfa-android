## Instructions to collaborate

We use "shared repository model" to work with the repository. There are two primary branches called "master" and "develop".
**As a rule and a good practice we shall never commit or push to these branches directly**.

- clone the repository
- always create a seperate branch for a particular user story or feature
- commit changes to the new branch and push to remote as your work going on
- once your work or feature is completed and well tested create a pull request
- after discuss and review the code, request can be merged to the "develop" branch
